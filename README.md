This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy when using the `eachWithIndex` iterator to modify the list being iterated. The `eachWithIndex` method doesn't create a copy of the list, so directly removing elements leads to unexpected behavior and potential `ConcurrentModificationException`.  The solution shows how to avoid this issue by iterating over a copy of the list or using a different approach such as `each` with index tracking.
